    "# Random Forest Classification for Car Safety Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on ensemble learning. In this project, I build two Random Forest Classifier models to predict the safety of cars, one with 10 decision trees and another with 100 decision trees. The expected accuracy increases with the number of decision trees in the model. Additionally, I demonstrate the **feature selection process** using the Random Forest model to find only the important features, rebuild the model using these features, and see its effect on accuracy. The **Car Evaluation Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for this project.\n"

    "\n",
    "Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It has two variations – one is used for classification problems and other is used for regression problems. It is one of the most flexible and easy to use algorithm. It creates decision trees on the given data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It is also a pretty good indicator of feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest algorithm combines multiple decision-trees, resulting in a forest of trees, hence the name `Random Forest`. In the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest results in higher accuracy.\n",

    "## 2. Random Forest Algorithm Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the Random Forest algorithm can be divided into two main stages: the training stage and the prediction stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Stage: Building the Random Forest\n",
    "In the first stage, we create the Random Forest by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Randomly select features**: From the total `m` features, we randomly select `k` features where `k < m`.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the best split**: For the selected `k` features, calculate the node `d` using the best split point.\n",
    "3. **Split the node**: Using the best split, divide the node into daughter nodes.\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 1 to 3 until the desired number of nodes `l` is reached.\n",
    "5. **Build the forest**: Repeat the above steps `n` times to create `n` decision trees, resulting in a Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Stage: Making Predictions\n",
    "Once the Random Forest is trained, the prediction process proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predict with individual trees**: For the test data, use the rules of each decision tree in the forest to make predictions.\n",
    "2. **Calculate votes**: After all trees make their predictions, calculate the number of votes each predicted outcome receives.\n",
    "3. **Final prediction**: The outcome with the highest number of votes is selected as the final prediction from the Random Forest algorithm.\n"

    "## 3. Advantages and Disadvantages of Random Forest Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Random Forest Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Versatility**: Random Forest can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.\n",
    "2. **Accuracy and Robustness**: It is considered a very accurate and robust model because it uses a large number of decision trees to make predictions.\n",
    "3. **Reduces Overfitting**: Random Forest takes the average of all the predictions made by the decision trees, which helps cancel out biases, reducing the overfitting problem.\n",
    "4. **Handles Missing Values**: Random Forest can handle missing values in the dataset. There are two ways to handle this:\n",
    "   - Use median values to replace continuous variables.\n",
    "   - Compute the proximity-weighted average of missing values.\n",
    "5. **Feature Selection**: Random Forest can be used for feature selection, identifying the most important features from the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Random Forest Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational Complexity**: The biggest disadvantage is its computational complexity. Random Forest is slow in making predictions because it uses a large number of decision trees. All trees in the forest must make a prediction for the same input, followed by voting, making it a time-consuming process.\n",
    "2. **Difficulty in Interpretation**: The model is more difficult to interpret compared to a single decision tree, where predictions can be easily traced and understood.\n"

    "\n",
    "Random Forests can be effectively used for the feature selection process. This algorithm can rank the importance of variables in both regression and classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Variable Importance:\n",
    "The importance of variables (or features) in a dataset is measured by fitting the Random Forest algorithm to the data. During the fitting process, the out-of-bag (OOB) error for each data point is recorded and averaged across the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Importance Calculation:\n",
    "The importance of the j-th feature is calculated after training by performing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The values of the j-th feature are permuted (shuffled) among the training data.\n",
    "2. The out-of-bag error is then computed on the modified dataset.\n",
    "3. The importance score for the j-th feature is computed by averaging the difference in OOB error before and after the permutation across all trees.\n",
    "4. This score is normalized by the standard deviation of these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features that produce larger scores are considered more important, while features that produce smaller scores are considered less important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection:\n",
    "Based on these importance scores, we select the most important features and drop the least important ones to build a more efficient model.\n"
